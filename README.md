============

Repository for team Ice Breakers during the Facebook Hackathon on October 19th.

Some of the lamest code we've ever written. It is very poorly documented and the reader might get sick reading it.

At least we have learned some new technologies:
- AngularJS
- Flask & SQLAlchemy
- Android API
- Facebook API

The components currently work on themselves but they are not entirely connected.
The server can login a user and add his pages to his profile. It exposes a REST API for communicating with
the webapp and mobile app.
